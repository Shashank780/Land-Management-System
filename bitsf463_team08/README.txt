Project: LAND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (Group 08)
    -Owing to the enormous amount of Land Disputes, a lot of time and resources are consumed by the Judicial System to solve these disputes. We design this project as a way to introduce the prospect of transparent and immutable transactions by implementing it through the concept of Blockchains.
    -Through our code, clients can record their owned properties, add new properties and sell their properties to the other clients without any fear of compromise in security and integrity of the transactions. The transactions are secure and immutable to prevent any sort of conflict or dispute over agreed terms.
